Well, my first project delivered from Spain.
Just a small project I was doing while studying programming for practice, nothing too serious, that one of the reasons i started this.

My idea was to replicate the calculators that you have on Windows. Why? Because the ones that i did while studying suck, and i wanted to do something more interesting. And it was, you have no idea how hard can be to do one of these.

Even tho it was just for practice, i still want to make a few improvements, like optimize the code to make it faster or make it customizable.

Advice will be well received.
